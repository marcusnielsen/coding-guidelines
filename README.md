# coding-guidelines
This set of guidelines should strive for few rules with high consistency.

## The four pillars of CRUD
The guidelines should prioritze, in order of importance, ease of:

1. **Deleting** code safely when a rewrite is needed.
2. **Updating** code in case of bugs or updated business needs.
3. **Reading** code to understand the application.
4. **Creating** code so it adds features while minimizing the overall complexity.

### Creating code


### Reading code
The code need to state **three questions of purpose**, in order of importance:
* **Why** was the code written? A non-programmer should be able to understand the business value.
* **What** does the code do? There should be a clear pipeline that describe what functions data flow through.
* **How** does the code work? It should be simple to **gain** understanding of how the code works.

### Updating code

### Deleting code
